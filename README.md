Repo for the paper Unsupervised Simplification of Legal Texts https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00557

## Dataset
We have gathered a new dataset for the goal of legal text simplification. To that aim, we have selected 1000 random legal sentences from the CaseLaw Access project of Harward Law School. Then, by collaborating with the faculty and the students of Bilkent Law School, we produced 3 different simplified reference files for these 1000 sentences. We hope that this dataset can serve as a benchmark for future legal text simplification studies.

## Code
In order to run the algorithm proposed in the paper, run the following command. Python 3.6 is required. In particular, run:
```
conda create -n uslt python=3.6.9
git clone https://github.com/koc-lab/lex-simple.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_uslt.py
```

After running the code above, you will generate a .txt file with lexical simplifications. In order to do structural simplification on top of lexical simplification, follow the steps in https://github.com/Lambda-3/DiscourseSimplification/tree/master. In particular, run
```
git clone https://github.com/Lambda-3/DiscourseSimplification.git
cd DiscourseSimplification
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
Then, generate an empty file called 'input.txt' inside this directory and copy and paste the lexically simplified document generated by the run_uslt.py code.
Then, run
```
mvn clean compile exec:java
python3 finer.py
cd ..
python decode_sentence_splitting.py
```
Now you generated the final txt file! 

## Evaluation

After gathering the text outputs, run 
```
python3 eval.py
```

you may need to install the readability and easse packages. For readability, run
```
pip install readability
```
or 
```
pip install https://github.com/andreasvc/readability/tarball/master
```

For easse, follow the guides in https://github.com/feralvam/easse
